===============

This contains all major version changes between click releases.

Version 2.0
-----------

(codename and release date to be decided)

- added support for opening stdin/stdout on Windows in
  binary mode correctly.
- added support for atomic writes to files by going through
  a temporary file.
- introduced :exc:`BadParameter` which can be used to easily perform
  custom validation with the same error messages as in the type system.
- added :func:`progressbar`; a function to show progress bars.
- added :func:`get_app_dir`; a function to calculate the home folder
  for configs.
- Added transparent handling for ANSI codes into the :func:`echo`
  function through `colorama`.
- Added :func:`clear` function.
- Breaking change: parameter callbacks now get the parameter object
  passed as second argument.  There is legacy support for old callbacks
  which will warn but still execute the script.
- Added :func:`style`, :func:`unstyle` and :func:`secho` for ANSI
  styles.
- Added an :func:`edit` function that invokes the default editor.
- Added an :func:`launch` function that launches browsers and applications.
- nargs of -1 for arguments can now be forced to be a single item through
  the required flag.  It defaults to not required.
- setting a default for arguments now implicitly makes it non required.
- changed "yN" / "Yn" to "y/N" and "Y/n" in confirmation prompts.
- added basic support for bash completion.
- added :func:`getchar` to fetch a single character from the terminal.
- errors now go to stderr as intended.
- fixed various issues with more exotic parameter formats like DOS/Windows
  style arguments.
- added :func:`pause` which works similar to the Windows ``pause`` cmd
  built in but becomes an automatic noop if the application is not run
  through a terminal.
