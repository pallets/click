Click Examples

  This folder contains various click examples.  Note that
  all of these are not runnable by themselves but should be
  installed into a virtualenv.

  This is done this way so that scripts also properly work
  on Windows and in virtualenvs without accidentally executing
  through the wrong interpreter.

  For more information about this see the documentation:
