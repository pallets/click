Parameters
==========

.. currentmodule:: click

Click supports only two principle types of parameters for scripts (by design): options and arguments.

Options
----------------

*   Are optional.
*   Recommended to use for everything except subcommands, urls, or files.
*   Can take a fixed number of arguments. The default is 1. They may be specified multiple times using :ref:`multiple-options`.
*   Are fully documented by the help page.
*   Have automatic prompting for missing input.
*   Can act as flags (boolean or otherwise).
*   Can be pulled from environment variables.

Arguments
----------------

*   Are optional with in reason, but not entirely so.
*   Recommended to use for subcommands, urls, or files.
*   Can take an arbitrary number of arguments.
*   Are not fully documented by the help page since they may be too specific to be automatically documented.  For more see :ref:`documenting-arguments`.
*   Can be pulled from environment variables but only explicitly named ones. For more see :ref:`environment-variables`.

On each principle type you can specify :ref:`parameter-types`. Specifying these types helps Click add details to your help pages and help with the handling of those types.

.. _parameter_names:

Parameter Names
---------------

Parameters (options and arguments) have a name that will be used as
the Python argument name when calling the decorated function with
values.

.. click:example::

    @click.command()
    @click.argument('filename')
    @click.option('-t', '--times', type=int)
    def multi_echo(filename, times):
        """Print value filename multiple times."""
        for x in range(times):
            click.echo(filename)

In the above example the argument's name is ``filename``. The name must match the python arg name. To provide a different name for use in help text, see :ref:`doc-meta-variables`.
The option's names are ``-t`` and ``--times``. More names are available for options and are covered in :ref:`options`.

And what it looks like when run:

.. click:run::

    invoke(multi_echo, ['--times=3', 'index.txt'], prog_name='multi_echo')
