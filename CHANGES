Click Changelog
===============

This contains all major version changes between Click releases.

Version 3.0
-----------

(codename and release date to be decided)

- formatter now no longer attempts to accomodate for terminals
  smaller than 50 characters.  If that happens it just assumes
  a minimal width.
- added a way to not swallow exceptions in the test system.
- added better support for colors with pagers and ways to
  override the autodetection.
- the CLI runner's result object now has a traceback attached.
- improved automatic short help detection to work better with
  dots that do not terminate sentences.
- when definining options without actual valid option strings
  now, Click will give an error message instead of silently
  passing.  This should catch situations where users wanted to
  created arguments instead of options.
- fix crash of :func:`echo_via_pager` under Python 3

  for configs.
- Added transparent handling for ANSI codes into the :func:`echo`
  function through `colorama`.
- Added :func:`clear` function.

- added :func:`getchar` to fetch a single character from the terminal.
- errors now go to stderr as intended.
- fixed various issues with more exotic parameter formats like DOS/Windows
  style arguments.
- added :func:`pause` which works similar to the Windows ``pause`` cmd
  built-in but becomes an automatic noop if the application is not run
  through a terminal.
- added a bit of extra information about missing choice parameters.
- changed how the help function is implemented to allow global overriding
  of the help option.
