$ complex_

  complex is an example of building very complex cli
  applications that load subcommands dynamically from
  a plugin folder and other things.

  All the commands are implemented as plugins in the
  `complex.commands` package.  If a python module is
  placed named "cmd_foo" it will show up as "foo"
  command and the `cli` object within it will be
  loaded as nested click command.

Usage:

  $ pip install --editable .
  $ complex --help
