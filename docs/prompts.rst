User Input Prompts
==================

.. currentmodule:: click

Click supports prompts in two different places.  One is automated prompts
when the parameter handling happens.  The second option is to ask for
prompts at a later point independently.

This can be accomplished with the :func:`prompt` function which asks for
valid input according to a type or the :func:`confirm` function which asks
for confirmation (yes / no).

Option Prompts
--------------

Option prompts are integrated into the option interface.  See
:ref:`option-prompting` for more information.  Internally it
automatically calls into :func:`prompt` or :func:`confirm` as necessary.

Input Prompts
-------------

To manually ask for user input you can use the :func:`prompt` function.
By default it accepts any unicode string but you can ask for any other
type.  For instance you can ask for a valid integer::

    value = click.prompt('Please enter a valid integer', type=int)

The type is also automatically detected if a default is provided.  The
following for instance will only accept floats::

    value = click.prompt('Please enter a number', default=42.0)

Confirmation Prompts
--------------------

To ask if a user wants to continue with an action the :func:`confirm`
function comes in handy.  By default it returns the result of the prompt
as boolean value::

    if click.confirm('Do you want to continue?'):
        click.utils.echo('Well done!')

There is also the option to make it automatically abort the execution::

    click.confirm('Do you want to continue?', abort=True)
