Advanced Patterns
=================

.. currentmodule:: click

In addition to common functionality that is implemented in the library
itself, there are countless of patterns that can be implemented by extending
click.  This page should give some inspiration of what can be
accomplished.

Command Aliases
---------------

Many tools support aliases for commands.  For instance you can configure
``git`` to accept ``git ci`` as alias for ``git commit``.  Other tools
also support auto discovery for aliases by automatically shortening them.

Click does not support this out of the box but it's very easy to customize
the :class:`Group` or any other :class:`MultiCommand` to provide this
functionality.

As explained in :ref:`custom-multi-commands` a multi command can provide
two methods: :meth:`~MultiCommand.list_commands` and
:meth:`~MultiCommand.get_command`.  In this particular case you only need
to override the latter as you generally don't want to enumerate the
aliases on the help page to avoid confusion.

This following example implements a subclass of :class:`Group` that
accepts a prefix for a command.  So if there is a command called
``push`` it would accept ``pus`` as alias if it's unique:

.. click:example::

    class AliasedGroup(click.Group):

        def get_command(self, ctx, cmd_name):
            rv = click.Group.get_command(self, ctx, cmd_name)
            if rv is not None:
                return rv
            matches = [x for x in self.list_commands(ctx)
                       if x.startswith(cmd_name)]
            if not matches:
                return None
            elif len(matches) == 1:
                return click.Group.get_command(self, ctx, matches[0])
            ctx.fail('Too many matches: %s' % ', '.join(sorted(matches)))

And it can be used like this then:

.. click:example::

    @click.command(cls=AliasedGroup)
    def cli():
        pass

    @cli.command()
    def push():
        pass

    @cli.command()
    def pop():
        pass

Invoking Other Commands
-----------------------

Sometimes it might be interesting to invoke one command from another
command.  This is generally a pattern that is discouraged with click but
possible nonetheless.  For this you can use the :func:`Context.invoke`
or :func:`Context.forward` methods.

They work similar but the difference is that :func:`Context.invoke` merely
invokes another command with the arguments you provide as a caller,
whereas :func:`Context.forward` fills in the arguments from the current
command.  Both accept the command as first argument and everything else is
passed onwards as you would expect.

Example:

.. click:example::

    cli = click.Group()

    @cli.command()
    @click.option('--count', default=1)
    def test(count):
        click.utils.echo('Count: %d' % count)

    @cli.command()
    @click.option('--count', default=1)
    @click.pass_context
    def dist(ctx, count):
        ctx.forward(test)
        ctx.invoke(test, count=42)

And what it looks like:

.. click:run::

    invoke(cli, prog_name='cli', args=['dist'])

Showing Long Texts
------------------

In some situations you might want to show long texts on the terminal and
let a user scroll through it.  This can be achieved by using the
:func:`echo_via_pager` function which works similar to the :func:`echo`
function but always writes to stdout and, if possible, through a pager.

Example:

.. click:example::

    @click.command()
    def less():
        click.echo_via_pager('\n'.join('Line %d' % idx
                                       for idx in range(200)))
