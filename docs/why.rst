Why Click?
==========

There are so many libraries out there for writing command line utilities,
why does click exist?

This question is easy to answer: because there is not a single command
line utility for Python out there which ticks the following boxes:

*   is lazily composable without restrictions
*   fully follows the UNIX command line conventions
*   supports loading values from environment variables out of the box
*   supports for prompting of custom values
*   is fully nestable and composable
*   works the same on Python 2 and 3
*   supports file handling out of the box

There are many alternatives to click and you can have a look at them if
you enjoy them better.  The obvious ones are ``optparse`` and ``argparse``
from the standard library.

click is actually implemented as a wrapper around ``optparse`` and does
not implement any parsing itself.  The reason it's not based on
``argparse`` is that ``argparse`` does not allow proper nesting of
commands by design and has some deficiencies when it comes to POSIX
compliant argument handling.

In case ``optparse`` ever gets deprecated and removed from Python,
``click`` will ship a version of it.

Click is designed to be fun to work with and at the same time not stand in
your way.  It's not overly flexible at the same time either.  Currently
for instance it does not allow you to customize the help pages too much.
This is intentional because click is designed to allow you to nest command
line utilities.  The idea is that you can have a system that works
together with another system by tacking two click instances together and
they will continue working as they should.

Too much customizability would break this promise.

Click was written to support the `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_
microframework ecosystem because no tool could provide it with the
functionality it needed.

To get an understanding of what click is all about I strongly recommend
looking at the :ref:`complex-guide` chapter to see what it's useful for.

Why not Argparse?
-----------------

Click is internally based on optparse instead of argparse.  This however
is an implementation detail that a user does not have to concern themselves
with.  The reason however click is not using argparse is that it has some
problematic behaviors that make handling arbitrary command line interfaces
hard:

*   argparse has builtin magic behavior to guess if something is an
    argument or an option.  This becomes a problem when dealing with
    incomplete command lines as it's not possible to know without having a
    full understanding of the command line how the parser is going to
    behave.  This goes against click's ambitions of dispatching to
    subparsers.
*   argparse currently does not support disabling of interspearsed
    arguments.  Without this feature it's not possible to safely implement
    click's nested parsing nature.

Why not Docopt etc.?
--------------------

Docopt and many tools like it are cool in how they work but very few of
these tools deal with nesting of commands.  To the best of the developer's
knowledge, click is the first Python library that tries to aim for
composability of applications that goes beyond what the system itself
supports.

For instance a click subcommand could accept all the arguments unparsed
and then be parsed with docopt if that command would want to work that
way.

Why Hardcoded Behaviors?
------------------------

The other question is why click goes away from optparse and hardcodes
certain behaviors instead of staying configurable.  There are multiple
reasons for this.  The biggest one is that too much configurability makes
it hard to achieve a consistent command line experience.

The best example for this is optparse's ``callback`` functionality for
accepting arbitrary number of arguments.  Due to syntactical ambiguities
on the command line there is no way to implement fully variadic arguments.
There are always tradeoffs that need to be made and in case of
``argparse`` these tradeoffs have been critical enough, that a system like
click cannot even be implemented on top of it.

In this particular case click attempts to stay with a handful of accepted
paradigms for building command line interfaces that can be well documented
and tested.
