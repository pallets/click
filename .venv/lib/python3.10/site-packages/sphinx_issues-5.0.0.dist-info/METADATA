A Sphinx extension for linking to your project's issue tracker. Includes roles for linking to issues, pull requests, user profiles, with built-in support for GitHub (though this works with other services).

Example
*******

For an example usage, check out `marshmallow's changelog <http://marshmallow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html>`_, which makes use of the roles in this library.

Installation and Configuration
******************************

.. code-block:: console

    pip install sphinx-issues


Add ``sphinx_issues`` to ``extensions`` in your ``conf.py``.

The extension has default values for GitHub projects.
Simply set the add the ``issues_default_group_project`` config variable and you are good
to go:

.. code-block:: python

    # docs/conf.py

    # ...
    extensions = [
        # ...
        "sphinx_issues"
    ]

    # Path to GitHub repo {group}/{project}  (note that `group` is the GitHub user or organization)
    issues_github_path = "sloria/marshmallow"

    # which is the equivalent to:
    issues_uri = "https://github.com/{group}/{project}/issues/{issue}"
    issues_prefix = "#"
    issues_pr_uri = "https://github.com/{group}/{project}/pull/{pr}"
    issues_pr_prefix = "#"
    issues_commit_uri = "https://github.com/{group}/{project}/commit/{commit}"
    issues_commit_prefix = "@"
    issues_user_uri = "https://github.com/{user}"
    issues_user_prefix = "@"

The extension is very configurable and can be used with any kind of
issue tracker. Here is how you could configure it for use
with a custom hosed GitLab instance:

.. code-block:: python

    # docs/conf.py

    # ...
    extensions = [
        # ...
        "sphinx_issues"
    ]

    #  Default repo {group}/{project} of gitlab project
    issues_default_group_project = "myteam/super_great_project"
    issues_uri = "https://gitlab.company.com/{group}/{project}/-/issues/{issue}"
    issues_prefix = "#"
    issues_pr_uri = "https://gitlab.company.com/{group}/{project}/-/merge_requests/{pr}"
    issues_pr_prefix = "!"
    issues_commit_uri = "https://gitlab.company.com/{group}/{project}/-/commit/{commit}"
    issues_commit_prefix = "@"
    issues_user_uri = "https://gitlab.company.com/{user}"
    issues_user_prefix = "@"


Usage inside the documentation
******************************

Use the ``:issue:``  and ``:pr:`` roles in your docs like so:

.. code-block:: rst

    See issue :issue:`42`

    See issues :issue:`12,13`

    See :issue:`sloria/konch#45`.

    See PR :pr:`58`


Use the ``:user:`` role in your docs to link to user profiles (GitHub by default, but can be configured via the ``issues_user_uri`` config variable).


Use the ``:commit:`` role to link to commits.

.. code-block:: rst

    Fixed in :commit:`6bb9124d5e9dbb2f7b52864c3d8af7feb1b69403`.

.. code-block:: rst

    Thanks to :user:`bitprophet` for the idea!

You can also use explicit names if you want to use a different name than the github user name:

.. code-block:: rst

    This change is due to :user:`Andreas Mueller <amueller>`.

The syntax ``:role:`My custom title <target>``` works for all roles of this extension.

It can be also used in combination with a list:

.. code-block:: rst

    Fix bad bug :issue:`123, (Duplicate) <199>`

Use the ``:pypi:`` role to link to PyPI on https://pypi.org.

.. code-block:: rst

    :pypi:`sphinx-issues` - A Sphinx extension for linking to your project's issue tracker.

Credit goes to Jeff Forcier for his work on the `releases <https://github.com/bitprophet/releases>`_ extension, which is a full-featured solution for generating changelogs. I just needed a quick way to reference GitHub issues in my docs, so I yoinked the bits that I needed.
