Documenting Scripts
===================

Click makes it very easy to document your command line tools.  First of
all, it automatically generates help pages for you.  While these are
currently not customizable in layout, all of the text can be changed.

Help Texts
----------

Commands and options accept help arguments.  In the case of commands, the doc
string of the function is automatically used if provided.

Simple example:

.. click:example::

    @click.command()
    @click.option('--count', default=1, help='number of greetings')
    @click.argument('name')
    def hello(count, name):
        """This script prints hello NAME COUNT times."""
        for x in range(count):
            click.echo('Hello %s!' % name)

And what it looks like:

.. click:run::

    invoke(hello, args=['--help'])

Arguments cannot be documented this way.  This is to follow the general
convention of Unix tools of using arguments for only the most necessary
things and to document them in the introduction text by referring to them
by name.

Preventing Rewrapping
---------------------

The default behavior of click is to rewrap text to work correctly for the
width of the terminal.  In some circumstances, this can become a problem.
The main issue is showing code examples where newlines are significant.

Rewrapping can be disabled on a per-paragraph basis by adding a line with
solely the ``\b`` escape marker in it.  This line will be removed from the
help text and rewrapping will be disabled.

Example:

.. click:example::

    @click.command()
    def cli():
        """First paragraph.

        This is a very long second paragraph and as you
        can see wrapped very early in the source text
        but will be rewrapped to the terminal width in
        the final output.

        \b
        This is
        a paragraph
        without rewrapping.

        And this is a paragraph
        that will be rewrapped again.
        """

And what it looks like:

.. click:run::

    invoke(cli, args=['--help'])


Meta Variables
--------------

Options and parameters accept a ``metavar`` argument that can change the
meta variable in the help page.  The default version is the parameter name
in uppercase with underscores, but can be annotated differently if
desired.  This can be customized at all levels:

.. click:example::

    @click.command(options_metavar='<options>')
    @click.option('--count', default=1, help='number of greetings',
                  metavar='<int>')
    @click.argument('name', metavar='<name>')
    def hello(count, name):
        """This script prints hello <name> <int> times."""
        for x in range(count):
            click.echo('Hello %s!' % name)

Example:

.. click:run::

    invoke(hello, args=['--help'])


Command Short Help
------------------

For commands, a short help snippet is generated.  By default, it's the first
sentence of the help message of the command, unless it's too long.  This can
also be overridden:

.. click:example::

    @click.group()
    def cli():
        """A simple command line tool."""

    @cli.command('init', short_help='init the repo')
    def init():
        """Initializes the repository."""

    @cli.command('delete', short_help='delete the repo')
    def delete():
        """Deletes the repository."""

And what it looks like:

.. click:run::

    invoke(cli, prog_name='repo.py')
